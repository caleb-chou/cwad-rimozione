### Setting up 3-D models
Due to storage limitations, 3-D models were not pushed to this repository. Steps to import them to the project:

- Read the ARCore ["Import and preview 3D assets"](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/sceneform/import-assets) page
- To be able to import models: File > Settings > Plugins > Search "Google Sceneform Tools (Beta)" > Install
- Sometimes sampledata dir option in Android Studio doesn't work, so manually make the directory sampledata/models/
- The downloadable 3-D models are [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_VZ-HavYb5JjYN5Kpg-YFD3Y-UwgZqP6)
